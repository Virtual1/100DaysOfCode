This is me trying to keep track of what I'm learning, and experimenting with tools & processes.
I've started #100daysofcode before, but it's been a while, and I haven't been trying consistently.
This is my attempt to keep better notes on what I'm doing and learning.

I have 3 BI reports to work on. Based on SQL2008 and Sage Evolution. (going to work with 2 different versions of Evolution)

1. Client request (v7.20.6): I need to track purchase orders (outstanding and delivered) placed in selected period (from date to date) on a supplier. 
These orders were placed based on a forecasted requirement from the customer, and I'd like to know the qty I've ordered vs their actual order placed during this period.

2. Client request (v7.20.6): I need to import sales forecast per customer, for the next year, and I need to see the actual vs budget for the current period, year to date, as well as last year's figures.

3. Client request (v6.81.48): I'd like to know the ageing of my stock. I need to know when I last sold each item, and when I last purchased each item, with last GRV cost.
